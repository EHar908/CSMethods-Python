### C++ SDP and UML Diagram Review

------------------------------------------------------------

My overall impression of the team's design is a positive one. As someone who has found it difficult to 
fully detail a design plan before getting into the actual coding and seeing what I'll need to use and 
what not -- the way they organized their ideas helped me with this project's planning.

The UML diagram helped me coordinate what's happening in which class, particularlly with the Menu and MenuOption classes. 
Since those were already done and converted to Python, it took me a little bit to look through them on my 
own. But after looking at the UML diagram and converting some of the syntax to Python, it helped give me
a better idea of what they were going for. Overall it was helpful for defining every nearly variable
and function that I'll likely have to use myself. 

In regards to their SDP, I liked how they explained the ideas for the classes and such in their phase 2 
before detailing the variables and function names. I've often just written my design out in paragraphs, 
but seeing how clear their work is with defined variables, ranges, and functions -- 
it's definiately something I'll look into doing with my own code. 

The class diagram definately helped me navigate the source code. I was having a hard time understanding the getString and getInt methods,
but after looking through the SDP and UML diagram, I saw that they were less of a function for the user to interact with and more of
a tool to use in the actual coding, making it so there would be less repetitive coding and such.
